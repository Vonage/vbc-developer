To use the Vonage Business Communications APIs, you must first request a developer account. 

To request an account, contact your Vonage Business Communications account representative.

You will use the developer account to:

1. [Log in to the Business Communications Developer Portal](/getting-started/logging-in)
2. [Create API applications](/getting-started/create-an-application)
3. [Subscribe to Vonage Business Communications APIs](/getting-started/subscribe-to-apis)

> Note: Your developer credentials are different than your Vonage Business Communications credentials and can only be used to log in to the Business Communications Developer Portal.
