#  Getting Started with the VBC Open ContactPad

The Open ContactPad SDK is a Javascript software development toolkit that allows developers to embed a [Vonage Unified Communications (UC)](https://www.vonage.com/unified-communications/) dialer interface into a web based application.  You will need a Vonage account to access the telephony APIs used by this SDK.  You can [sign up for a Vonage Businss Communications account online](https://www.vonage.com/unified-communications/pricing/?icmp=mainnav_buynow_novalue).  Once the account is activated, learn how to set it up with this [Getting Started Guide](https://businesssupport.vonage.com/articles/answer/Getting-Started-with-Vonage-Business-21753).

To use standalone communications APIs, see [Vonage APIs](/).

If you are interested in becoming a Vonage Partner to share your integration with all Unified Communications customers, please send an email to [bdpartner@vonage.com](mailto:bdpartner@vonage.com) including a description of your application.

With the Open ContactPad SDK, you can access the following functionality:

* You can embed a Vonage Unified Communications dialer interface into your own website or web application.
* You can place Vonage Unified Communications calls programmatically.
* You can write custom logic based on interaction lifecycle events (call start, call end, etc.)

Optionally:

* You can customize the dialer interface.
* You can bring your own contacts programmatically.

> NOTE: The Open ContactPad SDK is designed for embedding Vonage apps within web applications only.  It is not meant to create integrations with natively installed PC or Mac applications.
