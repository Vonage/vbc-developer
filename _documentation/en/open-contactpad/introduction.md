#  Getting Started with the VBC Open ContactPad

The Open ContactPad SDK is a Javascript software development toolkit that allows developers to embed a [Vonage Unified Communications (UC)](https://www.vonage.com/unified-communications/) dialer interface into an application.  You will need a Vonage account to access the telephony APIs used by this SDK.  You can sign up for a [Vonage Businss Communications account with a 14 day return period here](https://www.vonage.com/unified-communications/pricing/?icmp=mainnav_buynow_novalue).

To use standalone communications APIs, see [Vonage APIs](/).

With the Open ContactPad SDK, you can access the following functionality:

* You can embed a Vonage Unified Communications dialer interface into your own website or web application.
* You can place Vonage Unified Communications calls programmatically.
* You can write custom logic based on interaction lifecycle events (call start, call end, etc.)

Optionally:

* You can customize the dialer interface.
* You can bring your own contacts programmatically.
