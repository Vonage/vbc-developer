# Creating an Application

To use the Vonage Business Communications APIs, you must create a API application.

> Note: To avoid confusion, "application" in this context refers to a logical grouping of APIs.

## Create a new Application

1. Log in to the [Business Communications Developer Portal](https://apimanager.uc.vonage.com/) using your developer credentials and select **Vonage Business Communications** from the platform drop down list.
2. Select **My Applications** from the left-hand navigation menu.
3. Click **Add Application** at the top of the page.
4. On the **Add Application** dialog, enter a **Name** and an optional **Description** for your application so you can locate it later. You can limit the maximum number of requests each access token allows (see [authentication](/getting-started/create-an-access-token)) in the **Per Token Quota** drop-down menu. By default it is **Unlimited**.
5. Click the **Add** button.

> Now that you have created your application, you need to [subscribe to APIs](/getting-started/subscribe-to-apis) to use Vonage Business Communications APIs.
