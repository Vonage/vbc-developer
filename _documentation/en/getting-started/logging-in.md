#  Logging in to the developer portal

Once you've received your developer credentials you will need to log in to the Business Communications Developer Portal.

> Note: Your developer credentials are different than your Vonage Business Communications credentials and can only be used to log in to the Business Communications Developer Portal.

To log in to the Business Communications Developer Portal:

1. Visit the [Business Communications Developer Portal](https://apimanager.uc.vonage.com) login page.
2. Enter your developer credentials on the **Sign in to your account** form.
3. Click **Sign In**.

> Now that you're logged in, learn how to [create an API application](/getting-started/create-an-application) to start using the Vonage Business Communications APIs.
