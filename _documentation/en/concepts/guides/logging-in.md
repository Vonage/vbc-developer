#  Logging in to the Developer Portal

Once you've received your developer portal credentials you will need to log in to the developer portal.

> Note: Your developer portal credentials are different than your Vonage Business Communications credentials and can only be used to log in to the developer portal.

To log in to the Vonage Developer Portal:

1. Visit the [Developer Portal](https://developer.vonage.com).
2. Enter your Vonage Developer Portal login credentials on the **Sign in to your account** form.
3. Select **Vonage Business Communications** on the **Select Platform** drop-down menu.
4. Click **Sign In**.

> Now that you're logged-in, learn how to [create an API application](/concepts/guides/create-an-application) to start using the Vonage Business Communications APIs.
