# Creating an Application

To use the Vonage Business Communications APIs, you must create an API application.

> Note: To avoid confusion, "application" in this context refers to a logical grouping of APIs.

## Create a new Application

1. Sign into [Developer Portal](https://developer.vonage.com/store/) using your Vonage Business Communications credentials and select **Vonage Business Communications** from the platform drop down list.
2. Select **My Applications** from the left-hand navigation menu.
3. Click **Add Application** at the top of the page.
4. On the **Add Application** dialog, enter a **Name** and an optional **Description** for your application so you can easily locate it later. You can limit the maximum number of requests that each access token allows (see [authentication](/concepts/guides/create-an-access-token)) in the **Per Token Quota** drop-down menu. By default it is **Unlimited**.
5. Click the **Add** button.

> Now that you have created your application, you must [subscribe to APIs](/concepts/guides/subscribe-to-apis) to use Vonage Business Communications APIs.
