# Billing

Depending on how you use Smart Numbers, you might receive bills from both Vonage Business Communications and Vonage API Platform. All charges for voice usage in the Smart Numbers applications you create are included in your Vonage Business Communications bill. If your applications use other Vonage API Platform capabilities (such as Number Insight or Messaging) then you will receive a separate bill from Vonage API Platform for that usage.

> **Note** If you receive bills from both Vonage Business Communications and Vonage API Platform, the invoice schedule might not be the same.
